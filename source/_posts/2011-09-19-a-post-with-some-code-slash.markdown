Let's consider some code. Code might look like this. Or This. Or This:

``` 
- (void)someMethod:(NSString *)aParam withParam:(NSUInteger)anotherParam {
    // this is a comment, below we'd probably have some code
}

```

And that's all well and fine and all, but perhaps you want to do this:

```
void MyClass::MyMethod(std::string aStringParam, unsigned long aUnsignedParam) {
    /*
     * Here's another method with a comment in its body, only this time
     * it's C++!
     */
}
```

And that's all I have to say about that.

``` ruby
class Fixnum
  def prime?
    ('1' * self) !~ /^1?$|^(11+?)\1+$/
  end
end
```
